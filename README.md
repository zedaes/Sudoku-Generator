# Sudoku Generator

# Setup

First, make sure you have C installed on your device and `gcc` as a compiler.

Then, clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/zedaes/Sudoku-Generator.git`.

Lastly, run `chmod+x build.sh`, this allows you to run it as a command.

# How to Run

All you need to do to run is to enter the command `./build.sh` followed by the number of sudokus you want to create. For example for 100 sudokus you would run `./build.sh 100`.

It will then save the sudokus in a `.csv` file with one column being the puzzle, and the other being the solution.
